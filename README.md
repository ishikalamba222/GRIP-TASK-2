Unsupervised Learning is a machine learning technique in which the users do not need to supervise the model. Instead, it allows the model to work on its own to discover patterns and information that was previously undetected. It mainly deals with the unlabelled data.
K-means clustering is a type of unsupervised learning, which is used when you have unlabeled data (i.e., data without defined categories or groups). ... The algorithm works iteratively to assign each data point to one of K groups based on the features that are provided.

From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually, using K-means clustering and Unsupervised machine Learning.
